# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyses academic performance data of Portuguese students in mathematics using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Overview
The dataset consists of demographic, social, and academic indicators for male and female students. The goal of this project is to explore differences between groups, identify relationships between performance indicators, and build predictive models for student outcomes.

## Objectives
The analysis includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of male and female student datasets  
- Statistical comparison between groups using hypothesis testing  
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between indicators  
- Predictive modeling of student success using logistic regression  
- Final grade prediction using random forest regression  
- Identification of student group patterns using clustering techniques  

## Methods Applied
- Data preprocessing and standardization  
- Two-sample t-tests for group comparison  
- Pearson correlation analysis  
- Logistic regression with model selection (AIC)  
- Random forest regression for performance prediction  
- Model performance evaluation across multiple configurations  
- K-means clustering and alternative clustering techniques  

## Key Analytical Components
- PASS / FAIL classification based on grading thresholds  
- Feature importance analysis in predictive modeling  
- Model stability assessment using repeated random states  
- Cluster analysis to identify student subgroups  

## Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates the application of statistical inference and machine learning techniques to:

- Compare population groups  
- Predict outcomes using classification and regression models  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Identify hidden structures in data through clustering
